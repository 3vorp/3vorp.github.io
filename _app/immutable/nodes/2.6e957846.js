        Started in October 2022 as a hobby project of my own using the <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/">discord.py</a> framework, mostly as a joke, anyone can now run it by simply forking the repository and following the instructions in the README.

They&#39;ll generally cost between 5-10 USD, depending on complexity and time required.
        <br/><br/>
        I have well over two years of pixel art and graphic design experience under my belt, and have been doing commission work for nearly one and a half years. I prioritize client feedback above all and ensure maximum transparency throughout the designing process.
