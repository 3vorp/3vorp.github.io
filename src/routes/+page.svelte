    <h1>Welcome to my website!</h1>
    <p>
        I'm a pixel artist and programmer with experience in Python, Node.js, TypeScript, Svelte, Jekyll, and more recently Java, Vue.js, and Express.

    />
    </a>

    <p>
        I do commissions for small-scale pixel art work, such as Minecraft skins, textures, and profile pictures. They'll generally cost between 5-10 USD, depending on complexity and time required.
        <br><br>
        I have well over two years of pixel art and graphic design experience under my belt, and have been doing commission work for nearly one and a half years. I prioritize client feedback above all and ensure maximum transparency throughout the designing process.

    <h2 align="center">Discord Bots</h2>

    </a>

    <p>
        I've worked on multiple different Discord bots before, serving a wide variety of purposes from an automated texture pushing system for Minecraft resource packs to a fully functioning Wordle command.
        <br><br>
        I've been familiar with the Discord API and both Discord.js and Discord.py for over a year, and built multiple bots with it in JavaScript, TypeScript, and Python.
