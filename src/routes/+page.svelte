    Faithful is a collection of open source and community-driven Minecraft resource packs, aiming to provide a higher-resolution version of the default Minecraft textures while staying true to the originals.
    <br><br>
    I'm a co-owner and manager of the project, and have been involved for over two years in its development. I help with <a href="https://github.com/Faithful-Resource-Pack/Website">website</a> development, <a href="https://github.com/Faithful-Resource-Pack/Discord-Bot">Discord bot</a> development, <a href="https://docs.faithfulpack.net/pages/textures/contributor-handbook">texture making</a>, and much more.
    <br><br>
    You can join our <a href="https://discord.gg/sN9YRQbBv7">Discord server</a> to help us contribute to the project, give feedback, or just generally chat with us, or click the image on the left to view our website.

    spunch bot is a general-purpose Discord bot, featuring per-server custom prefixes, an intuitive feedback ticket system, global announcements from a customizable whitelist, and much more.
    <br><br>
    Started in October 2022 as a hobby project of my own using the <a href="https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/">discord.py</a> framework, mostly as a joke, anyone can now run it by simply forking the repository and following the instructions in the README.
    <br><br>
    You can click the image on the right to get started with cloning and installing the bot anywhere.

    <p>
    I do commissions for small-scale pixel art work, such as Minecraft skins, textures, and profile pictures. They'll generally cost between 5-10 USD, depending on complexity and time required.
    <br><br>
    I have well over two years of pixel art and graphic design experience under my belt, and have been doing commission work for nearly one and a half years. I prioritize client feedback above all and ensure maximum transparency throughout the designing process.
    <br><br>
    If you are interested in commissioning me, please let me know via Discord by clicking the link on the left and sending a friend request. We can then proceed in direct messages.
