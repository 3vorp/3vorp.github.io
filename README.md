## personal site that's supposed to plug all the stuff I've made but hasn't been seriously worked on in like 6 months so is more like a slightly nicer version of my github readme

- made using sveltekit (and scss/typescript)

- now featuring:
    - gambling simulator
    - barely functional mobile optimization
    - dependencies that will probably break if you breathe on them too hard
    - a deploy process so complicated I have no idea how it even works
    - super cool reactive navbar and footer components please check them out they took me so long

more coming soonâ„¢
