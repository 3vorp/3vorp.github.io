## random site that mostly serves as a nicer looking mirror of my github readme with some additional info

- made using sveltekit

- now featuring:
    - gambling simulator
    - barely functional mobile optimization
    - dependencies that will probably break if you breathe on it too hard
    - a deploy process so complicated I have no idea how it even works

more coming soonâ„¢
